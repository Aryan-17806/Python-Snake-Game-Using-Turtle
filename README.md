# Snake Game by Aryan Singh

Welcome to **Snake Game**, a fun and engaging Python project created by Aryan Singh! 🐍 This simple yet addictive game lets you control a snake as it moves around the screen, eating food, growing longer, and trying to avoid collisions.

## Features
- 🎮 **Interactive Gameplay**: Control the snake using arrow keys.
- 🕹️ **Dynamic Difficulty**: The game speeds up as you progress.
- 🏆 **Score Tracking**: Keep track of your current and high scores.
- 🌈 **Customizable**: Easily tweak colors, shapes, and sizes in the code.

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it [here](https://www.python.org/).
2. Install the required libraries if you don't already have them:
   ```
   pip install turtle
   ```
3. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
4. Open the `snake_game.py` file in your Python editor or IDE.
5. Run the program and start playing!

## How to Play
- Use the **arrow keys** to navigate the snake around the screen.
- Eat the food to grow longer and increase your score.
- Avoid the edges of the screen and your own body segments, or the game will reset.
- Try to beat your **high score**!

## Notes
- This project is built entirely using the `turtle` module, so no external graphics libraries are required.
